            <p>Jaguars are the third-largest big cats in the world and are known for their powerful bite, which can crush the shells of turtles and pierce through the skulls of prey. Unlike most other big cats, they enjoy swimming and often hunt in water, making them adept at catching fish and caimans.</p>

            <p>Cheetahs are the fastest land animals, capable of reaching speeds up to 60 miles per hour in short bursts covering distances of about 1,500 feet. Their unique body structure, with a lightweight frame and large nasal passages, allows for incredible acceleration, enabling them to go from 0 to 60 mph in just a few seconds.</p>

            <p>Lions are the only big cats that live in social groups called prides, which typically consist of related females, their cubs, and a few dominant males. Known as the "king of the jungle," lions can roar loudly enough to be heard up to five miles away, using their vocalizations to communicate and establish territory.</p>
